The same project is available in two version:
 - first one is the same of the orinal forked repo, but implemented on the Ultra96 v2 board;
 - second one is a slightly more complex version that makes use of an AXI lite interface to send to the moving average IP the information about windows size and    dimension of the input stream instead of sending them as the first two values of the stream;

This README will (let's hope soon) be updated to better explain the designs and the notebooks.
